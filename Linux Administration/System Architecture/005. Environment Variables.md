# Environment Variables
Environment variables are same as linking library and different at the same time. It's hard to explain but just remember that with environment variables we can link our custom lib also can do some other cool stuff which we will see later.


### Add Library with Environment Variables
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/Ahsan/lib/
```

This command will add `/home/Ahsan/lib/` to our lib config for this specific user. If we want to check lib added through environment variables then we need to run,
```bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

# Boot Loader
It boots the system. It runs before the OS starts. Some popular linux bootloaders are,
- `LILO` - Linux Loader
- `GRUB` - Grand Unified Boot Loader

NOTE: GRUB  has 2 version. Older one called GRUB Legacy and the newer one called GRUB2 which is widely used by most if not all of the linux distro.

GRUB located at `/boot` directory. Config file stores at `/boot/grub` folder. Though the config file name can be vary by the distro or grub version like `menu.lst`, `grub.conf` but in most system `grub.cfg` is being used.

### Change GRUB Configs
However these files are auto generated and lots of codes written in bash so modification is hard  and most likely bootloader will die if we try to change without knowing. But there are easy way to change configuration as well. For that `/etc/default/grub` file needs to be edited. After we edit configs from here we need to run `sudo update-grub` to update configs. Then finalize the configs by running   `sudo grub-install /dev/sdX` cmd.

### Boot into Rescue Mode From GRUB Menu
Go to edit commands option from grub menu and add `systemd.unit=rescue.target` at the end of the linux kernel line. Then press `F10` to boot into rescue mode.

NOTE: In case you don't know how to go to edit commands option or didn't notice the writing below the grub menu, press `e` to open the edit commands option.
